# Epsilon Ventures

Epsilon Ventures is an independent app development company.
We specialize in developing applications for both iOS & Android. We oversee all of the stages of the project lifecyle -- from ideation to implementation. We handle every phase in the application life including wireframing, architecture & high-level design, implementation, release, and marketing & promotion.

## Portfolio
We have developed several apps for both iOS and Android. Below are some of our favorite.

Dog Whistle is a free application that helps you to train your dog.

Dog whistles emit sounds in the high frequency range. Humans can only hear up to 20 kHz, but dogs have much better hearing. Since dog whistles are silent to humans, but loud to dogs, they are perfect for training dogs.

## [Tone Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epsilonv.highfrequencytonesignalgenerator)

MP3 Tag Editor is a beautifully designed application that allows you to edit the MP3 tags of all your favorite songs. In addition, this application also lets you change the Cover Art (or Album Art) of your top songs.
